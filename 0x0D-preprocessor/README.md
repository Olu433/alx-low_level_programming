# Preprocessor
Project done during **Software Engineering Studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C Programming.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using gcc
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu

### Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename  | 	Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0-object_like_macro.h | 	Header file that defines a macro named SIZE |
| 1-pi.h |	Header file that defines a macro named PI |
| 2-main.c | 	Prints the name of the file it was compiled from |
| 3-function_like_macro.h | 	Function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x |
| 4-sum.h | 	Function-like macro SUM(x,y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y  |
